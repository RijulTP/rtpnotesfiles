## 1. Perform data smoothing by bin means on 3 equi-width bins.Data: [24,27,29,16,17,31,33,29,36,37,35,44]

## 2. Explain concept hierarchy with an example.

## 3. Perform data smoothing by bin means on 3 equi-width bins. Data: [20,24,23,12,15,20,31,29,35,36,32,40]

## 4. What is the purpose of data discretization? List any two data discretization strategies

## 5. Justify the significance of pre-processing the data before mining.

## 6. Explain the two sampling methods used in data reduction.

## 7. Suppose a group of 12 sales price records has been sorted as follows: 5, 10, 11, 13, 15,35,50, 55,72,92,204,215. Sketch examples of each of the following sampling techniques: SRSWOR, SRSWR, cluster sampling, stratified sampling. Use samples of size 5 and the strata "youth," "middle-aged," and "senior."

## 8. Real-world data tend to be incomplete, noisy and inconsistent. What are the various approaches adopted to clean the data?

## 9. Describe the various techniques for numerosity reduction in data mining.

## 10. Why do we need data transformation? What are the different ways of data transformation?


## 11. Suppose that the data for analysis includes the attribute cost price and the values for the data tuples are: 100,150,140,115,190,120,130,125,135,145,140,150, 165,160,170
### (i) Use min-max normalization to transform the value of 145 for cost price onto the range [0,1].
### (ii) Use Z-Score normalization to transform the value 145 for cost price where the standard deviation of cost price is 120.



## 12. Real-world data tend to be incomplete, noisy and inconsistent. What various approaches adopted to clean the data?


## 13. Describe the various techniques for numerosity reduction in data mining.

## 14. Suppose a group of 12 sales price records has been sorted as follows: 5, 10, 11, 13, 15, 35, 50, 55,72,92,204,215. Sketch examples of each of the following  sampling techniques: SRSWOR, SRSWR, stratified sampling. Use samples of size 5 and the strata 'youth," "middle-aged," and "senior'"


## 15. Discuss the significance of data di.scretization in data mining. List and explain any four data discretization strategies.

## 16. Illustrate PCA for dimensionality reduction with an example.

## 17. Explain various methods for dealing with missing data. Justify its significance.

## 18. Explain data normalization methods with necessary equations. Calculate the normalized value for 550 in the set of the data points 50, 150, 250, 350,450, 550, 650, 700, 850, 950, 1000 using
### (a) min-max normalization by setting min=0 and max=I
### (b) z-score normalization
### (c) Normalization by decimal scaling
