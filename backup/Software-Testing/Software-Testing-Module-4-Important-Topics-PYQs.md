## 13. Explain pair-wise coverage and T-wise coverage with examples.

## 14. Explain three different types of Black Box testing

## 15. Discuss the two approaches for input space modelling. Also write pros and cons of each method

## 16. Discuss the following coverage criteria in equivalence class portioning a) All combinations coverage (ACoC) b) Each choice coverage (ECC) c) Pair-wise coverage d)Base Choice Coverage

## 17. Differentiate between boundary value analysis and equivalence class portioning

## 18. Consider the triangle classification specification. The system reads in three positive values from the standard input. The three values  A,B,C are interpreted as representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle . The system then prints a message to the standard output saying whether the triangle, if it can be formed, is scalene, isoceles, equilateral or not a triangle. Develop a decision table to generate testcases for this specification
